# SVM Classifier with Grid Search and Learning Curves

This project implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for the Magic Data Set from the UCI repository. The objective is to optimize the model's hyperparameters using random grid search and visualize the learning curve for the best-performing model.

## Requirements

Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Dataset

The dataset used is the "Magic Data Set" from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which contains 10 numerical features describing objects classified as either "Higgs" or "Gamma." The goal is to predict the class of each object.

URL: [Magic Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/magic/magic04.data)

The dataset contains the following columns:

- `fNames`, `fWidth`, `fSize`, `fConc`, `fConc1`, `fAsym`, `fM3Long`, `fM3Trans`, `fAlpha`, `fDist`: Numerical features
- `Class`: Target variable with two classes (Higgs or Gamma)

## Steps

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**:
   - The dataset is loaded from the provided URL and assigned appropriate column names.
   - Basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed, including shape and missing value checks.
   - A count plot is generated to visualize the distribution of classes.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - The features are standardized using `StandardScaler` to improve model performance.
   - The dataset is split into features (`X`) and target variable (`y`).

3. **Model Training and Hyperparameter Optimization**:
   - A random grid search is performed across four different kernel types: `'linear'`, `'poly'`, `'rbf'`, and `'sigmoid'`.
   - For each kernel, random values for hyperparameters `C` (regularization) and `gamma` (kernel coefficient) are chosen within the range [0, 1].
   - The model is trained using SVM for each configuration, and the accuracy is computed to find the best hyperparameters.

4. **Learning Curves**:
   - Once the best model is identified, learning curves are generated to visualize the training and cross-validation accuracy as a function of the training size.
   - This helps to analyze model performance across different sizes of the training dataset and understand convergence.

## Code Overview

The code is organized into the following steps:

- **Data Loading**: 
   - Data is fetched from a URL and processed.
  
- **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - The features are scaled using `StandardScaler` for uniformity in training.
  
- **Model Training**: 
   - SVM with grid search is used to identify the best kernel and hyperparameters.

- **Learning Curve Visualization**: 
   - Learning curves are plotted to show how accuracy changes with different training sizes.

## Results

The model will output the best kernel, `C`, and `gamma` for each split of the data. Additionally, a learning curve plot for the best configuration will be displayed, showing how the model's accuracy improves with increasing training size.

## Example Output

For each sample of the dataset, the best kernel, `C`, and `gamma` are printed:

```
Sample 1 | Accuracy: 0.98, Kernel: rbf, Nu: 0.67, Epsilon: 0.45
Sample 2 | Accuracy: 0.97, Kernel: linear, Nu: 0.32, Epsilon: 0.14
...
```

A learning curve graph is plotted for the best model, showing training accuracy and cross-validation accuracy.
